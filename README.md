## **‚ú® Features**

Screen Dimmer is more than just a simple brightness tool. It's a robust application designed for a seamless user experience.

* **Advanced Brightness Control:** Dim your screen's brightness level from 0% to 90%, allowing you to go far darker than the default Windows settings.  
* **Multi-Monitor Support:** Applies settings consistently across all connected displays.  
* **Dynamic Monitor Handling:** Automatically detects when monitors are connected or disconnected and adjusts the overlays on the fly without needing a restart.  
* **Color Temperature Slider:** Intuitively adjust the screen tint from a neutral black to a warm, sepia-like orange to reduce blue light and ease eye strain at night.  
* **Blue Light Filter:** A dedicated slider to apply a blue tint, giving you granular control over the color profile of your screen.  
* **One-Click Presets:** Instantly apply predefined brightness levels for common scenarios like "Reading," "Movie," and "Night."  
* **System Tray Integration:** Runs quietly in your system tray to avoid cluttering your taskbar. Double-click to show controls, right-click for a quick menu.  
* **Global Hotkeys:** Control the application from anywhere in Windows without needing to open the control panel.  
  * Ctrl \+ ‚Üë: Increase brightness  
  * Ctrl \+ ‚Üì: Decrease brightness  
  * Ctrl \+ Shift \+ X: Exit the application  
* **Start with Windows:** A simple checkbox lets you set the application to launch automatically when you log in.  
* **Persistent Settings:** Remembers your last used brightness, color temperature, and blue light filter settings for the next time you start the app.  
* **Lightweight & Portable:** The entire application is a single, standalone .exe that requires no installation.
